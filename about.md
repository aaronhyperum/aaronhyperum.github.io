My name is Aaron, but my fascination with aliases when I was younger caused much of my online presence to be attributed to the name 'Hyperum'. Here, I won't post very often but include detailed accounts when I do. This site will also be more personal, but my innermost thoughts be kept to myself, of course. Please enjoy!

You can find my Github profile along with my code repositories at
{% include icon-github.html username="aaronhyperum" %}.


My Twitter account with the same name is located at
{% include icon-twitter.html username="aaronhyperum" %}.
