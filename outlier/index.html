                My mother, Lisa Yeoh, was born on the 21st of November, 1967 to a poor Chinese family living in Penang, Malaysia, under the name of Soon Hwa. Together with her parents and four other siblings, she lived on the first floor of a tiny, single-roomed apartment.
                Throughout primary and secondary school, she found herself the most academically focused in her family, getting A’s in almost all of her subjects. For her efforts, she was rewarded with the privilege of going to the University of Malaya,
                where she achieved similar results. In university, she met my dad during a sports event between her university and the National University of Singapore. Soon after graduation, she moved to Singapore to live with my dad, and has since acquired
                experience as high level directors in three different pharmaceutical companies. She often gives credit to hard work, perseverance, and discipline for her success, but such remarkable levels of economic mobility are not common, and it’s clear that compared to the general population, she is an outlier - an exception to the norm. Exceptional people come from exceptional circumstances, and here, we shall embark on a journey through my mother’s life to discover what circumstances guided her along this path to success (Personal Interview 1).

            <p>April, 1977</p>

            <p> A loud rap on the door catches Soon Hwa by surprise, as she drops the duster on the chair she had just cleaned. She has no time to groan about the extra work she has just cost herself, as a call rings out from the house:</p>

            <p> &ldquo;Ah Hwa, please answer the door! I&rsquo;m washing the clothes right now!&rdquo; The call comes from her mother, who has been busy with housekeeping the whole day. She releases the latch and opens the door to find a young boy from her
                neighbourhood on the front steps, grinning.</p>

            <p> &ldquo;One green bean ice cream, please!&rdquo;</p>

            <p> Her mother had taken up to selling ice cream and other snacks to the children in their neighborhood to supplement her father&rsquo;s monthly income of $200, which was not quite enough to sustain the family of seven. She sold various flavors,
                such as durian and bandung - a concentrated rose syrup - but the one she was most famous for was green bean ice cream, which she stewed in a large pot before storing it in the refrigerator. The &lsquo;ice cream&rsquo; was more of a sorbet,
                and was stored in plastic tubes of several sizes.</p>

            <p> Soon Hwa rushes to the refrigerator to get the last remaining tube of green bean ice cream, and returns to the door, where the boy gives her ten cents for the purchase. Her chores and homework finished, she begins to settle down for the afternoon.
                As she sifts through her pile of books, each bought with school-given vouchers, she finds one. &ldquo;The Wishing Chair Again,&rdquo; she recites, &ldquo;by Enid Blyton&ldquo;. Despite having read the story dozens of times, each time had
                been just as entertaining as the first: for her, nothing was more enjoyable than the dream-like immersion into the worlds of magic these novels would provide. She sits down on the rattan mat covering her bedroom floor - her family had
                not enough money to pay for beds - and as her siblings run outside to play, Soon Hwa begins to read.</p>

            <p>During her childhood, my mother&rsquo;s family did not have the money to pay for books. Instead, much of her collection was bought with vouchers for the book-store, handed out by her school, but not exactly for free. Instead, these were given
                as prizes for outstanding academic achievement during ceremonies every year. In these ceremonies, my mother found that those who tended to continually get good scores in school tended to be the richer children, which was not exactly surprising.</p>

            <p> In fact, my mother&rsquo;s family were so poor they couldn&rsquo;t afford to buy the textbooks for studying. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t get to buy books,&rdquo; she commented. &ldquo;Those who were below a certain income level were considered
                as poor [and could] get book loans.&rdquo; Other poor children also had to work with the fact that they could not spend as much time studying because they were needed in doing chores and other kinds of work. My mother was extremely lucky
                to be able to set aside time for studying.</p>

            <p> Of course, this isn&rsquo;t to say my mother wasn&rsquo;t active - in fact, it was quite the opposite. She would often go for after-school gymnastics tutoring, which she put a lot of effort into in her younger years. To add to that, my mother
                was proactive as well. Every year, during teacher&rsquo;s day, her class &ldquo;would be asked to do a performance&rdquo; for the teachers. She would always volunteer to be part of the performing group of students, despite her lack of
                knowledge about dance. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how I built my confidence and courage,&rdquo; she remarked. </p>

            <p> My mother&rsquo;s father would work as a nursing assistant in Penang General Hospital for about seven hours a day, earning just about a ringgit each hour - or just under fifty American cents today. This was definitely not enough to sustain
                my mother&rsquo;s family of five. Her parents would buy their food and other items from a small store in their neighborhood, and would often not have enough money and would had to pay their debts off at the end of the month. Her mother
                would have to sell snacks for extra money, and the children were expected to help in every way they could.</p>

            <p> Her academic life started to become more difficult as she entered secondary school. She was offered a choice between two streams of subjects: the science or art streams. She made the choice based on her sister&rsquo;s advice: &ldquo;Clever
                students go to the science stream.&rdquo; It was not all peer pressure - she had been curious about the sciences early on. However, the first year after her choice, she began to regret it: the teachers teaching science had, in her opinion,
                no idea how to teach. &ldquo;The teachers killed my interest in science&rdquo;, she lamented later on. After that first year, she made up her mind to go into business upon entering university to avoid such a calamity happening again (Personal
                Interview 1).</p>

            <p>It was three years ago that representatives of a German university came to her school to tell them about the opportunities for continuing education in Germany. To her amazement, all this high quality education was offered for free!</p>

<p> &ldquo;Free?!&rdquo; her mother exclaims as she received the news. &ldquo;Aside from the costs for the plane ticket, you&rsquo;ll need to pay thousands for rental per month! We don&rsquo;t have that kind of money.&rdquo; Soon Hwa was disillusioned. &ldquo;In fact, we probably won&rsquo;t have enough money to send you to university here,&rdquo; her mother continued.</p>

<p> These same words reverberated in her head as she waited for her turn for her interview for a scholarship. Sitting inside the building of the Kuok Foundation, cooled only by a single fan, she was the last interview candidate left that afternoon. All of her life had been leading up to this one moment, which would define her future in education and in the workforce. This was her last chance to get the funds for her stay in university. She had to win this.</p>

<p> Lisa heard the click of the handle as the door to the interview room opened, and a young lady walked out. &ldquo;Yeoh Soon Hwa?&rdquo; a voice called from inside. As she walked in the room, she met eyes with the interviewer. I am ready, she assured herself. I can do this.</p>

                Luck and compassion definitely played a large role in the fact that my mother managed to get a scholarship from Kuok Foundation. Whilst her remarkable grades were necessity to continuing her education, the Malaysian government had begun implementing racial
                quotas for public universities, which the University of Malaya was, to the benefit of ethnic Malays, which my mother was not (Personal Interview 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                But what led to the implementation of affirmative action in Malaysian education? Shortly after independence from Britain in 1957, ethnic Malays began to question how committed their new government was to them. The striking disparity between
                the socio-economic statuses of ethnic Malays and the Chinese immigrant population led them to believe that the government was too friendly with Chinese interests. On the contrary, the Chinese began to suspect that the Malay government
                was discriminating against them by giving ethnic Malays special privileges. The tensions culminated in May of 1969, when deadly riots broke out in the capital of Kuala Lumpur, leading to a declaration of national emergency (Income Inequality).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1970, with undertones of the riots still lingering, the government drafted the New Economic Plan, which among other goals, planned to implement an “ethnic quota system in the proportion of 55:45 for Bumiputera [ethnic Malays] and non-Bumiputera students…
                as the basis for admission to public universities” (“Growing up”). For most Malaysians, this would have been beneficial as almost seventy percent of ethnic Malays were under the poverty line. Chinese and Indian students made up the majority
                of the high-scorers in school, as the poorer students, most of whom were Malay, were unable dedicate time to studying (Personal Interview 2). Whilst many Chinese Malaysians were unaffected by the quotas, wealthy enough to pursue their
                education overseas, twenty-seven percent of them still lived in poverty, including my mother and her family, and simply were out of luck (Income Inequality).
            </p>
            <p>
                In my mother’s eyes, it was the compassion and charity of the one woman who conducted her interview that led to her being awarded a scholarship. She had, in fact, already enrolled in the University of Malaya and gone through several scholarship interviews
                already. Had she not been able to get this scholarship, she would have had to have gotten her family to redirect their entire salaries to her education, or cancel it altogether.

                Because the majority of Chinese Malaysians were extremely wealthy in comparison to the other ethnic populations, they were disadvantaged as part of the New Economic Plan's affirmative action policy, to the detriment of economically disadvantaged Chinese
                Malaysians such as my mother and her family ("Income Inequality").

                Regardless, my mother managed to do just as well in university as she did in the years before. Despite having decided to take science-related courses in secondary school, she made the decision to switch to buisness, due to the horrible experience she
                had with the science teachers. Many of the skills she learned in these courses would become useful in her employment in management years later. One of them was the ability to make use of a state-of-the art invention that had just taken over the world: the personal computer (Personal Interview 2).

            “So, welcome to the cultural convention project team! Your name is… Lisa?” the senior asked.


She nodded.


“Since your job is to compare our budget to our sponsors’ donations, you will be compiling your spreadsheets on this,” the senior explained, gesturing proudly to the lone computer in the room. An IBM 5150, the machine was large, bulky, and unlike anything Lisa had ever seen before.  “It was tough getting the university to buy one for us, “ he laughed, as he powered up the computer.


Lisa sat down, as the firmware loaded up. “For now, there’s only really one command you need to know.” She watched as the senior typed out l-o-t-u-s in the command line and hit enter. “Lotus 123. This program creates graphs from the data you put in. I’ll leave you with the built-in tutorial, which will give you an explanation of how to use this program.” He entered a few more keystrokes to load the tutorial, and promptly got up and left the room.

	“1-2-3 is a powerful analytical tool. You can use it to perform a wide variety of tasks. These include: preparing budgets, developing business plans, performing standard accounting functions… and much more”, the screen read.





	A childlike sense of wonder began to build up inside her. What could be possible with this machine? Only time will tell, she thought to herself.
