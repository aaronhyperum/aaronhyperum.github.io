                My mother, Lisa Yeoh, was born in the 21st of November, 1967 to a Chinese family living in Penang, Malaysia, under the name of Soon Hwa. Together with her parents and four other siblings, she lived in a the first floor of a tiny, single-roomed apartment.
                Throughout primary and secondary school, she found herself the most academically focused in her family, getting A’s in almost all of her subjects. For her efforts, she was rewarded with the privilege of going to the University of Malaya,
                where she achieved similar results. In university, she met my dad during a sports event between her university and the National University of Singapore. Soon after graduation, she moved to Singapore to live with my dad, and has since acquired
                experience as high level directors in three different pharmaceutical companies, today earning more than $200,000 a year. She often gives credit to hard work, perseverance, and discipline for her success, but such remarkable levels of economic
                mobility are not common, and it’s clear that compared to the general population, she is an outlier - an exception to the norm. Exceptional people come from exceptional circumstances, and here, we shall embark on a journey through my mother’s
                life to discover what circumstances guided her along this path to success (Personal Interview 1).

            <p>April, 1977</p>

            <p> A loud rap on the door catches Soon Hwa by surprise, as she drops the duster on the chair she had just cleaned. She has no time to groan about the extra work she has just cost herself, as a call rings out from the house:</p>

            <p> &ldquo;Ah Hwa, please answer the door! I&rsquo;m washing the clothes right now!&rdquo; The call comes from her mother, who has been busy with housekeeping the whole day. She releases the latch and opens the door to find a young boy from her
                neighbourhood on the front steps, grinning.</p>

            <p> &ldquo;One green bean ice cream, please!&rdquo;</p>

            <p> Her mother had taken up to selling ice cream and other snacks to the children in their neighborhood to supplement her father&rsquo;s monthly income of $200, which was not quite enough to sustain the family of seven. She sold various flavors,
                such as durian and bandung - a concentrated rose syrup - but the one she was most famous for was green bean ice cream, which she stewed in a large pot before storing it in the refrigerator. The &lsquo;ice cream&rsquo; was more of a sorbet,
                and was stored in plastic tubes of several sizes.</p>

            <p> Soon Hwa rushes to the refrigerator to get the last remaining tube of green bean ice cream, and returns to the door, where the boy gives her ten cents for the purchase. Her chores and homework finished, she begins to settle down for the afternoon.
                As she sifts through her pile of books, each bought with school-given vouchers, she finds one. &ldquo;The Wishing Chair Again,&rdquo; she recites, &ldquo;by Enid Blyton&ldquo;. Despite having read the story dozens of times, each time had
                been just as entertaining as the first: for her, nothing was more enjoyable than the dream-like immersion into the worlds of magic these novels would provide. She sits down on the rattan mat covering her bedroom floor - her family had
                not enough money to pay for beds - and as her siblings run outside to play, Soon Hwa begins to read.</p>

                Luck and compassion definitely played a large role in the fact that my mother managed to get a scholarship from Kuok Foundation. Whilst her remarkable grades were necessity to continuing her education, the Malaysian government had begun implementing racial
                quotas for public universities, which the University of Malaya was, to the benefit of ethnic Malays, which my mother was not (Personal Interview 1).
            </p>
            <p>
                But what led to the implementation of affirmative action in Malaysian education? Shortly after independence from Britain in 1957, ethnic Malays began to question how much the committed their new government was to them. The striking distextity between
                the socio-economic statuses of ethnic Malays and the Chinese immigrant population led them to believe that the government was too friendly with Chinese interests. On the contrary, the Chinese began to suspect that the Malay government
                was discriminating against them by giving ethnic Malays special privileges. The tensions culminated in May of 1969, when riots broke out in the capital of Kuala Lumpur, leading to a declaration of national emergency (SBROSLAN).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1970, with undertones of the riots still lingering, the government drafted the New Economic Plan, which among other goals, planned to implement an “ethnic quota system in the proportion of 55:45 for Bumiputera [ethnic Malays] and non-Bumiputera students…
                as the basis for admission to public universities” (“Growing up”). For most Malaysians, this would have been beneficial as almost seventy percent of ethnic Malays were under the poverty line. Chinese and Indian students made up the majority
                of the high-scorers in school, as the poorer students, most of whom were Malay, were unable dedicate time to studying (Personal Interview 2). Whilst many Chinese Malaysians were unaffected by the quotas, wealthy enough to pursue their
                education overseas, twenty-seven percent of them still lived in poverty, including my mother and her family, and simply were out of luck (SBROSLAN).
            </p>
            <p>
                In my mother’s eyes, it was the compassion and charity of the one woman who conducted her interview that led to her acquisition of a scholarship. She had, in fact, already enrolled in the University of Malaya and gone through several scholarship interviews
                already. Had she not been able to get this scholarship, she would have had to have gotten her family to redirect their entire salaries to her education, or cancel it altogether.

            <p>
                Because the majority of Chinese Malaysians were extremely wealthy in comparison to the other ethnic populations, they were  disadvantaged as part of the New Economic Plan's affirmative action policy, to the detriment of economically disadvantaged Chinese Malaysians such as my mother and her family ("Income").

                Regardless, my mother managed to do just as well in university as she did in the years before. Despite having decided to take science-related courses in secondary school, she made the decision to switch to buisness, due to the horrible experience she had with the science teachers. Many of the skills she learned in these courses would become useful in her employment in management years later.
